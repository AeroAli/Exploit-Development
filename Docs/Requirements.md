# Requirements

## Section 1: - Developed under Windows XP with No DEP

* Proof that the flaw exists.
* The development process of an exploit that proves the concept, such as running Calculator or Notepad.
* In your tutorial, you should include analysis of: -
  * The amount of space that is there for shellcode (i.e. at the top of the stack).
  * Any character filtering (or not) that occurs.
* You should then exploit the vulnerability using a more complex payload (such as a shell or reverse shell).
* You should then also illustrate the concept of egg-hunter shellcode.

## Section 2: - Developed under Windows XP - With DEP enabled in (“Opt Out” mode)

* This section should illustrate how ROP chains can be used to execute shellcode.
